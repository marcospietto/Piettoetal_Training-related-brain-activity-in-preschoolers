# Piettoetal_Training-related-brain-activity-in-preschoolers
These are the EEG data from Pietto et al (JCE, 2021). This project is part of a larger collaboration between the Unidad de Neurobiología Aplicada (CEMIC - CONICET, Argentina; http://pobrezaydesarrollocognitivo.blogspot.com/) and the Laboratorio de Inteligencia Artificial Aplicada (Instituto de Cs. de la Computación, Fac. de Cs. Exactas y Naturales, UBA - CONICET, Argentina; https://liaa.dc.uba.ar/). Our general goal is to study the influence of adverse environmental conditions on brain function and the effectiveness of cognitive interventions for changing neural activity underliying executive functions's demanding tasks.
In the present study, we examined the impact of two individualized cognitive training interventions on cognitive performance and neural activity in preschoolers from poor homes. Participants were classified based on their basal performance (i.e. high- and low-performers) in an inhibitory control task, and then separated into intervention and control groups within each performance level. The control groups completed three games without cognitive control demands. The intervention groups performed three activities with increased cognitive demands adjusted according to their cognitive baseline performance. Children were trained weekly for 12 weeks and tested before and after the intervention, at kindergarten, using EEG recordings during a Go/NoGo task performance. Training-related changes were observed only for children who participated in the intervention activities. Low-performers exhibited changes in behavior (i.e. post-error slowing) and mid-frontal neural activity (i.e. N2) associated with conflict processing. However, the high-performers group had larger training effects on conflict-related activity (i.e. N2, ERN, theta power).
